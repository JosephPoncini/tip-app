// Peer Review: Tip calculator functions well - now I'll never have to question how much my friends owe me after a meal, thanks Joseph! :grin: p.s. I'd suggested adding a slight border radius to your input boxes + reset button and making the reset button the strong Cyan color when there are fields that can be reset, overall awesome job!
